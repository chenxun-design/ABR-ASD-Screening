# ABR-ASD Screening

An AI-powered screening tool for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) signals.

## Overview

This project implements a deep learning framework for early ASD screening using ABR signals. The core model is a dual-branch Time-Frequency Fusion and Transformer-based Network (TF-TBN) that achieves state-of-the-art performance in ASD identification.

## Key Features

TF-TBN Model: Dual-branch time-frequency fusion network 

CNN-LSTM Baseline: Traditional deep learning comparison

Data Processing: ABR waveform extraction and feature engineering

Model Interpretation: Explainable AI for clinical insights

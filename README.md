# ABR-ASD-Screening
This repository contains the implementation of TF-TBN (Time-Frequency Transformer-Based Network), a novel deep learning model for ASD identification using full-band ABR signals. The model integrates temporal and frequency domain features through a dual-branch architecture combining Transformer networks and Vision Transformer.
